						<h2>M. Jeffrey Mei</h2>
						<p>
							I was born in Taiwan and moved to New Zealand at age 3. I went to <a href="http://www.westlake.school.nz" rel="nofollow">Westlake Boys High School</a> in Auckland, New Zealand, where I completed <a href="http://www.cie.org.uk/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-advanced/cambridge-international-as-and-a-levels/">Cambridge International Examinations A levels</a> in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and German and also sat <a href="http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/qualifications-standards/awards/new-zealand-scholarship/">New Zealand Qualifications Authority Scholarship</a> exams, receiving Scholarships in English, Art History, Chemistry and Mathematics with Calculus and an Outstanding Scholarship in Statistics and Modelling.
</p><p>
For my undergraduate education, I was offered a full scholarship to  <a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/" rel="nofollow">New York University Abu Dhabi</a>, a small liberal arts college in the United Arab Emirates, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science <i>cum laude</i> with a double major in Mathematics and Physics. As part of my liberal arts education, I took classes on a wide range of topics, from world literature to legal jurisprudence. I also spent two semesters studying abroad, one at each of <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/global/global-academic-centers/berlin.html" rel="nofollow">NYU Berlin</a>/<a href="https://www.hu-berlin.de/en" rel="nofollow">Humboldt Universit&auml;t zu Berlin</a> and <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/" rel="nofollow">NYU Washington Square</a>. I have done summer research with <a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/faculty/ingyin-zaw.html">Dr. Ingyin Zaw</a> at the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics at NYU, <a href="http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/">Dr. David Hogg</a> at the Max-Planck Institut f&uuml;r Astronomie in Heidelberg, <a href="http://physics.as.nyu.edu/object/AndyHaas.html">Dr. Andy Haas</a> at the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics at NYU and <a href="http://caos.cims.nyu.edu/object/davidholland">Dr. David Holland</a> at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU.
</p>
<p>
I am now at the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Applied Ocean Science & Engineering working under Dr. Ted Maksym (WHOI) as a PhD student.
<p>
Outside of research, I am interested in foreign languages, art history, classical music and the aviation industry.</p>
